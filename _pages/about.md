<h2><b>About</b></h2>

<!--color="#8a2be2"--> <!-- 3250*4333 -->
I am a second-year master's student at University of Tsukuba, currently working in the research group of Prof. Tuan Phung-Duc. My research interests lie in applied probability and stochastic analysis, particularly in performance evaluations for wireless networks and sharing economy. My current goal is to explore the properties of random environments and non-intuitive phenomena in social systems. I also aim to explain them clearly by using stochastic models.
