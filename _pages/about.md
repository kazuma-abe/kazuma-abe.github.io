## About
I am a master student of University of Tsukuba, Japan. My research interests are the applied probability and the stochastic analysis. Especially, I am interested in applying the quantitive approaches (Stein's method, stochastic geometry and so on) to a Queueing system.

<!-- My Ultimate goal is to identify what is acutually happened or not by using the probability theory or new methods! --> 


## Educational Background
<!-- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
